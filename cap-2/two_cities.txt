large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his
way to his breakfast.
The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the
gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and
as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so
still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee,
and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine
texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore
an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which
wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more
as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though
not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the
tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks
of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed
and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist
bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some
pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank.
He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore
few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in
Tellson’s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people;
and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily
off and on.
Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused
him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:
“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come
here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may
only ask for a gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”
“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”
“Yes.”
“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and
Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s
House.”
